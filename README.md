# Verlet List and Cells

The purpose of this project is to experimentally find an optimal extra radius parameter for the Verlet list data structure in order to solve the n-body problem.

Furthermore, a grid is used to partition the system's 2-D box and to take advantage of this, the interactions among non-neighbor cells are considered to be zero. This can be done because each cell size is sufficiently large.
